Besides programming, python, and pushing my brains to its limit, I also have another hobby. My Jack Russell Terrier. I adopted him five years ago and he is over 15 years old now. His name is Diesel and he makes sure that I also have my relaxing moments. A dog needs to walk at least three or four times a day, the more the better. He makes sure that I wonâ€™t skip his walks and makes sure that my mind can take a rest once in a while. The love for a dog is just undescribed, I think one can only know this feeling if you have a dog yourself.

Even though he can be a tough one, a dog with an instruction manual, he is also the best mirror one can have. If I am stressed, he will feel that. If I am happy, he is happy. If I am too hyper, he will get even more hyper. Walking him makes both of us go into a relaxing state. Walking him is the best remedy when not being able to fix the bugs that unfortunately occur in programming. Taking a step backward, going outside, chilling my mind, often ends in actually being clear minded again and being able to fix that problem where I have been looking at for the last eight hours. A nice small walk, thirty minutes away from the screen, bonding time with Diesel, is often the best solution to fixing anything programming related. Thank you for that, Diesel!
