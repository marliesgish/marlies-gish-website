It’s been a while since updating my website. I started creating this website, but it was put on a long hold since some other data science stuff crossed my path. It is amazing to look back to my last posts and see how far I’ve come in the last 1,5 years.

What progress have I made in the world of Data Science? Well, first of all I started an official retraining program at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences, called Business and Data Analytics. It was an extensive fulltime course, with a duration of 6 months. I learned so much during this course. I learned to build my own Data Ware House from unstructured data from an SAP system, using Visual Studio, Python, SQL and Power BI. Even though I did many online Python and SQL courses and was already familiar with that, I had no clue about the whole process, from a to z. Now I would say that I feel confident in most of the steps in building a Datawarehouse, transforming data, visualizing data and also doing some machine learning.

Even though it kind of felt like diving into the deep, the unpredictable, the unknown, it was the best choice ever. I could barely work for 6 months because I completely wanted to focus on Data Science. However, it got rewarded right away. Within a month I had my first official job as a Data Specialist at Novalinq!

I know Data Science is a topic where you are never done learning. Now I am lucky, because I never actually want to stop learning! I think I won the lottery by ever making this decision to start doing data science and I will always cherish this.

Looking back at my to do list in my blog post on 2020-02-19 and could proudly say I have been working quite hard to achieve my goals:
-	Continue the online Udemy course The Complete SQL Bootcamp - DONE 02-03-2020
-	Start the online Udemy course Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp - DONE 04-05-2020
-	Find a certified study to elaborate my knowledge in data analytics – Done and completed at Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences ‘Business and Data Analytics’
-	Find an internship where I can learn much more about Data Science – Even better: I started a my first job as a Data Specialist
-	Install Linux on my laptop and understand all the ins and outs of this operating system – Still planning to do
