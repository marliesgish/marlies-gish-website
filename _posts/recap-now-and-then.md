Itâ€™s been a while since updating my website. It was put on a long hold since some other Data Science stuff crossed my path. It is amazing to look back to my last posts and see how far I have come in the last 1,5 years.

What progress have I made in the world of Data Science? Well, first of all I started an official
retraining program at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences, called [Business and Data Analytics](https://it-omscholing.nl/business-data-analytics/). It was an extensive fulltime course, with a duration of 6 months. I learned so much during this course. I learned to build my own Data Warehouse (DHW) from unstructured data from an SAP system, using Visual Studio, Python, SQL and Power BI. Even though I did many online Python and SQL courses and was already familiar with that, I had no clue about the whole process, from a to z. Now I would say that I feel confident in most of the steps in building a DWH, transforming data, visualizing data and also doing some machine learning.

Even though it kind of felt like diving into the deep, the unpredictable, the unknown, taking part in this retraining program was the best choice ever. I had to quit my fulltime job because the retraining program was a fulltime job itself.However, it got rewarded right away. Within a month after graduating this program I had my first official job as a Data Specialist at [Novalinq](https://www.novalinq.com)!

I know Data Science is a topic where you are never finished learning. Now I am lucky, because I never actually want to stop learning! I think I won the lottery by ever making this decision to start doing data science and I will always cherish this.

Looking back at my to do list in my [blog post](/blog/my-own-training-program) on 2020-02-19 I can proudly say I have been working quite hard to achieve my goals. I finished all of the mentioned Udemy courses, found and finished a certified studie to elaborate my knowledge in Data Science and programming, and found a job as a Data Specialist.
