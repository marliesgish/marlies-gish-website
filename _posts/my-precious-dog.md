Besides programming, python, and pushing my brains to its limit, I also have another hobby. My darling Diesel. He is a Jack Russell Terrier whom I adopted 5 years ago. He is over 15 years old now and he makes sure that I also have my relaxing moments. A dog needs to walk at least three or  four times a day, the more the better. He makes sure that I wonâ€™t skip his walks and makes sure that my mind can take a rest once in a while. The love for a dog is just undescribed, I think one can only know this feeling if you have a dog yourself.

Even though he can be a tough one, a dog with an instruction manual, he is also the best mirror one can have. If I am stressed, he will feel that. If I am happy, he is happy. If I am to hyper, he will get even more hyper. Walking him makes both of us go into a relaxing state. Walking him is the best remedy when not being able to fix the bugs that unfortunately occur in programming. Taking a step backward, going outside, chilling my mind, often ends in actually being clear minded again and being able to fix that problem where I have been looking at for the last 8 hours. A nice small walk, 30 minutes away from the screen, focusing on the bond with my precious dog Diesel, is often the best solution to fixing anything programming related. Thank you for that, Diesel!
