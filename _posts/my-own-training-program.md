Why I love making my own training program
High school was quite an ambiguous period for me. Surely I was interested in learning new stuff, but I wanted to learn what I thought was interesting and worthwhile. Why should I study history? Or geography? I did not feel the worthiness with geography, nor with history.

The funny thing is, I loved PE, but not in the way it was taught in high school. I could just not understand the meaning of it all. Just give me a ball and let me play my game with my team and have fun. That is what PE is to me! And that is also what Python and data analysis is for me. While programming in this language I have fun and feel very inspired by the need to learn everything as detailed as possible.

Nowadays our culture demands so much not only of children, but of grown-ups as well. You must follow a fairly strict regimen, study a broad range of subjects, while only 10% sticks, in the end the 10% that really matters. Having fun, knowing your skills, your strengths and weaknesses, that is what is valuable. When unleashing yourself from the bounds of society and following your heart, it is amazing how each person has the capacity to create their own program. The potential to achieve goals you would want to attain, learning to make a better version of yourself and expanding your knowledge above and beyond what is expected of you.

The conclusion to all of this is that I am happiest when I can do what I enjoy most. When something feels useful, I want to know all about it and want to learn as much as possible. So this is what I did, using Statistics and Psychology as a solid foundation, setting new goals to learn more and more about Data Science. Having left the starting blocks, I am learning more about programming in Python and the race is picking up speed. Using this tool to visualize the world around me keeps me flying.

Book: Python Crash Course by [Eric Matthes](https://twitter.com/ehmatthes?lang=en)
I started out with a book that I got as a present. This book has helped me so much in becoming more excited about all the possibilities that Python offers. The book consists of 2 parts, the first part focuses on Python in general. The basic stuff like lists, dictionaries, functions, classes, all you need to know to make code snippets and small programs. The second part is the fun part. It consists of three main projects with some small side projects and practices.

The first project is about making a game, using the library Pygame. The idea is to make an alien game where a spaceship has to shoot the aliens moving down towards the spaceship. I was completely amazed by all the details you should focus on and everything one should keep in mind. At first, I got a little lost, there was so much to think about! By practicing and being sure to understand one step at a time, I slowly made progress. My strategy was to understand everything I did, before going onto the next step. Right now, I can almost dream of the code which made it so much easier to create new programs and new code.

The second project is an introduction into Data Analysis, using libraries such as matplotlib, numpy, and requests. For me, the most interesting part was the use of APIs. As a beginner, this was completely new to me. It felt so good that you can use information and formatted data to create nice graphs and figures! One exercise was about making a visualization of all the earthquakes in the world of the last 24 hours. Relative earthquake magnitudes are color-coded using a color pallet, how cool is that!

The third part is about making a web application, using Django. To be honest, I have put this project on hold for the time being. I cannot share my experience with this, because I got distracted by another course on Udemy. I subscribed a couple of months ago, and all of a sudden I felt this inner pressure and excitement of finishing this course before anything else. The course that I am talking about is described below.

Online Udemy Course: Complete Python Bootcamp: Go from zero to hero in python 3
This course was a little bit of a repetition of the book Python Crash Course that I just wrote about here. However, it is always good to repeat and practice as much as possible. The nice thing about this course is that it is very interactive. You use Jupyter Notebook to create some small programs and try out small pieces of code. The course alternates between lectures and exercises. The most fun and interesting part was the final capstone project, which consists of plenty of ideas of small programs you can make and in that way practice a lot. The thing I liked about this is that there is not just one solution to these exercises. It is a challenge to create the best logical program, which is understandable for others, and not too complicated. This involves a tricky balance between elegance and readability, and I am definitely not there yet. I tried out different coding styles making this same program. The exercises I did you can find [here](https://github.com/marliesgish/python-first-practice-2020).

To do
As you can see, I am just starting. I have so many things I still want to do and learn, and it is hard for me to think about where to start. I subscribed for some other courses on Udemy which I still need to finish and there is also a book I would like to read. This is what is still on my to do list:

- Continue the online Udemy course The Complete SQL Bootcamp
- Start the online Udemy course Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp
- Find a certified study to elaborate my knowledge in Data Science and programming
- Find an internship where I can learn much more about Data Science
- Install Linux on my laptop and understand all the ins and outs of this operating system
