My love for statistics started way back. In the days when they called it Mathematics. Of course, I am talking about my time in high school. Physics and Mathematics were the two topics that gave me some meaning to my school life and actually motivated me to attend school. I loved learning about the formulas in physics that explained those daily events in life which before I had had no clue about. For instance, the simplistic beauty of gravity was an eye opener for me. Also, the intricate ways that eyes work, how positive and negative lenses can improve vision. Or using my hands and building small tools using wind energy. My favorite math subject was geometry: calculating the volume of certain shapes, given some formulas which could be represented in a graph. How fun to crack my brains and discover on my own the one and only solution!

> This was the perfect opportunity to combine the interesting parts of Psychology and using statistics as a tool to explore possible explanations for seemingly erratic human behavior.

After high school, my broad journey through the wonderful world of statistics became more specific. It was not so much geometry anymore, but more hard core statistics. During my Bachelor program, we started out with the following basics:

- Reliability and Validity
- T and z-values
- Linear regression
- Logistic regression
- Anova/Ancova
- Binary response variables
- Missing data (Multiple imputations)

I realized that statistics was by far the most interesting and fun topic for me at the University. In order to take the theoretical aspects of statistics and apply them to a real world situation, I chose for a Research Master in Psychology. This was the perfect opportunity to combine the interesting parts of Psychology and using statistics as a tool to explore possible explanations for seemingly erratic human behavior. Here is a list of statistical topics in my research Masters:

- Item Response Theory
- Logistic Regression
- Non-linear regression
- Meta analysis (fixed effects-model vs random-effects model, meta-regression)
- Principal component analysis
- Mediators and moderators
- Missing data (Multiple imputations and analysis of variance)
- Multilevel modeling
- Propensity scores

Honestly, I would be stretching the truth if I would claim to still know everything I learned during those courses. The important thing is that I passed all those courses and enjoyed being involved in them with all of my heart. I saved all the lectures and assignments on my computer, and as nerdy as I might be, I still look at them sometimes. By reading them every now and then, those sentimental feeling of my fun parts at the University are re-ignited.
