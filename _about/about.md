Let me answer this question by first introducing myself. I am a 30 something year old, trying to follow my dreams and live my life as best as possible. Looking at my resume, you can see that I have always chosen to do and study what I think was interesting at that period of my life, without really looking what the future would bring choosing that path. Studying psychology was great, working as a psychologist was and is still interesting. There was just one missing part, one unfulfilled piece in me. A hobby that I was missing, a hobby focusing on numbers, math, science. So that is where my new journey into Data Analytics began.

## Some facts

- 🧠 works at an addiction clinic
- 👩‍🎓 has a research master in psychology
- ☕️ requires at least two cups a coffee a day
- 🧮 mathmetics

I have always been intrigued by numbers, puzzles, math and science. I want to know and understand. Everything. The great thing about math, is that so much can be explained logically using rules and laws. There is always a formula, there is always an explanation, a solution, some logic behind it. The interesting part is when combining this straightforward logic with Psychology. People are so different, so many confounding factors, an explanation and a well-defined solution is hard to find.

During my studies, my favorite courses involved statistics, the more complicated, the more interesting it seemed. That is also why I chose to do a research Master. Lots and lots of statistics, analyzing data to help explain and predict the world around me. The fun part about University was also that me and my fellow students often had to work together as a team. We worked together on projects and brainstormed about how to solve certain problems. After my studies I did some research on the Internet to see which programming language was most popular among the Data Scientists. Python seemed to be the number one choice, so that made me decide to start a basic online course in Python and discover for myself more about programming.

ight now, I am trying to find my way further into Data Science and explore this hobby. There is so much going on in this world of Data Science, that sometimes, I don't even know where to start anymore. However, step by step, I know I will get there.

Update 25-10: After doing 1,5 years of self study and learning the ins and outs in Python, I decided I needed some drastic changes in order to make my journey successful. Mid 2020 I started a full time study in Business and Data Analytics, which I have not regretted for a single moment! It is the most interesting, fun and elaborating study and I am super happy to be part of this!
